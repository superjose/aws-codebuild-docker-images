# About This Project.

This is a repo that was forked from the original aws codedeploy with the purpose of recreating a public .NET Core 2.2 image (Which, as of this writing, Dec. 15 2018, hasn't been supported by AWS in The CodePipeline).

This will be connected with cloud.docker.com so it gets automatically built and published on the cloud.
